### Brief Task Description

Tim is looking for a place to build a house. The street he wants to live on has length n, it consists of n identical consecutive sections. Each plot is either empty or house already built on the place.
Sociable Tim does not want to live far away from other people on this street. Therefore, it is important for him to know for each plot the distance to the nearest empty plot. If the plot is empty, this value will be equal to zero - the distance to itself.
Help Tim calculate the required distances. For this putrpose you have a street map. Houses in the city of Timo were numbered in the order in which they were built, so their numbers on the map are not ordered in any way. Empty areas are marked with zeros.

### Input Format
  
The first line contains value, the length of the street —– n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106). 
The next line contains n non-negative integers — the numbers of houses and designations of empty plots on the map (zeroes). 
It is guaranteed that there is at least one zero in the sequence. House numbers (positive numbers) are unique and do not exceed 109.

### Output Format
  
For each segment, print the distance to the nearest zero. Output the numbers on one line, separating them with spaces.
